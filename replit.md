# Discord Moderation Bot

## Overview

This is a feature-rich Discord moderation bot built with Discord.js v14. The bot provides comprehensive server moderation capabilities including auto-moderation for spam and content filtering, manual moderation commands, user management, and a web dashboard for monitoring.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Core Framework
- **Node.js** runtime environment
- **Discord.js v14** for Discord API integration
- **Express.js** for web server and dashboard
- **SQLite3** for local database storage
- **Event-driven architecture** with modular command and event handling

### Directory Structure
- `/commands/` - Slash commands organized by category (moderation, utility)
- `/events/` - Discord event handlers (ready, messageCreate, etc.)
- `/handlers/` - Command and event loading systems
- `/automod/` - Automated moderation systems
- `/middleware/` - Permission and authentication systems
- `/database/` - Database connection and management
- `/web/` - Web dashboard with Express server
- `/utils/` - Shared utilities and helper functions
- `/config/` - Configuration management

## Key Components

### 1. Command System
- **Slash commands** using Discord.js builders
- **Category-based organization** (Moderation, Utility, etc.)
- **Permission-based access control** with configurable levels
- **Dynamic command loading** with hot-reload capability
- **Cooldown management** to prevent spam

### 2. Auto-Moderation System
- **Spam Detection**: Message frequency, duplicate content, and suspicious patterns
- **Content Filtering**: Profanity, slurs, toxic phrases, and spam phrases
- **Invite Link Detection**: Automatic detection and filtering of Discord invites
- **Automated Actions**: Warnings, mutes, and escalation based on violation severity
- **Nuke Detection**: Advanced protection against mass destructive actions (channel deletion, role manipulation, mass bans)
- **Raid Detection**: Intelligent detection of coordinated server attacks and mass join events

### 3. Advanced Security System
- **Real-time Threat Detection**: Continuous monitoring of audit logs and user actions
- **Automated Response System**: Immediate protective actions based on threat severity
- **Risk Scoring**: AI-powered suspicious user detection with configurable thresholds
- **Emergency Lockdown**: Manual and automatic server protection during attacks
- **Security Dashboard**: Comprehensive monitoring and analytics through web interface

### 4. Permission System
- **Role-based permissions** with configurable role mappings
- **Permission levels**: Owner (5), Admin (4), Moderator (3), Helper (2), User (1), Banned (0)
- **Hierarchical moderation** preventing lower-level users from moderating higher-level users
- **Guild-specific settings** allowing per-server customization

### 5. Database Layer
- **SQLite3** for persistent data storage
- **User management** with guild-specific records
- **Moderation logging** for all actions taken
- **Warning system** with configurable thresholds
- **Mute tracking** with automatic expiration
- **Security event logging** for nuke and raid attempts

### 6. Web Dashboard
- **Express.js server** with security middleware
- **Real-time bot statistics** and monitoring
- **Security analytics** with threat detection metrics
- **REST API endpoints** for data access
- **Static file serving** for dashboard interface
- **Security headers** and request logging

## Data Flow

### Command Processing
1. Discord event received (slash command or message)
2. Permission validation against user's role and level
3. Command parameter validation and parsing
4. Business logic execution with database operations
5. Response generation with embeds and logging

### Auto-Moderation Flow
1. Message content analysis for violations
2. Spam pattern detection and user history checking
3. Severity assessment and action determination
4. Automated response execution (delete, warn, mute, etc.)
5. Logging and notification to moderators

### Event Handling
1. Discord events captured by event handlers
2. Guild-specific settings retrieval from database
3. Business logic execution (welcome messages, role assignment, etc.)
4. Database updates and logging

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **discord.js**: Discord API wrapper and gateway client
- **express**: Web server framework for dashboard
- **sqlite3**: SQLite database driver
- **sqlite**: Promise-based SQLite wrapper

### Configuration Requirements
- **DISCORD_TOKEN**: Bot token from Discord Developer Portal
- **CLIENT_ID**: Application ID for slash command registration
- **OWNER_ID**: Discord user ID for bot owner permissions
- **LOG_LEVEL**: Logging verbosity (debug, info, warn, error)

### Discord Permissions Required
- Read Messages/View Channels
- Send Messages
- Use Slash Commands
- Manage Messages (for purge and auto-mod)
- Kick Members
- Ban Members
- Timeout Members (for muting)
- Manage Roles (for auto-role assignment)
- View Audit Log (for moderation logging)

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Setup
- Node.js environment with npm package management
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- SQLite database file creation and schema initialization
- Log directory structure for persistent logging

### Scaling Considerations
- SQLite suitable for small to medium deployments
- Can be migrated to PostgreSQL for larger scale operations
- Stateless design allows for horizontal scaling
- Web dashboard can be separated for independent scaling

### Security Measures
- Permission validation at multiple layers
- Input sanitization and validation
- Rate limiting through cooldown systems
- Secure headers in web dashboard
- Environment variable protection for sensitive data

### Monitoring and Logging
- Structured logging with timestamps and levels
- Auto-moderation action logging
- User activity tracking
- Performance metrics collection
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
